Because it's impossible to deploy ERC1820 contracts to Celo network, we decided:
- To use a custom deployed version of ERC1820
- Keep the standard ERC1820 address when deploying to eth networks
- Manually change the ERC1820 address in all contracts when deploying to Celo networks
- Change the ERC1820 address field to be variable
- Add a function to update the ERC1820 when it becomes available
- When ERC1820 becomes available, we'll:
  - upgrade the bridge contract so new side tokens will use the standard ERC1820 address
  - update the ERC1820 address in the bridge contract
- Old side tokens will keep using the custom ERC1820
